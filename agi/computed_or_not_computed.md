Limitation of the universal computing machine.

Investigate the notion of General Artificial Intelligent (AGI) as a proxy of computational algorithm. I want to answer three questions concerned the position of intelligent in computing machine:

* First, I want to research the definition of AGI and differentiate it from narrow intelligent (a.k.a A.I). Recent advances in A.I often being extrapolated as a closer step to machine understanding, since it is unlikely the case, I want to dive depth into the evidence that the computational machines' failure modes. The implication defies the purpose of the machine itself, hence, raises an existential of these algorithms.
* Second, I want to investigate the possibility of AGI regarding our computational platform. Quantum computer, a superior new form of computation, has been known to only provide merits in solving certain problems (i.e. narrow domain intelligent). As a result, it is questionable that the direction toward AGI would involve a more powerful machine or the redefinition of computation itself.
* Finally, I want to understand the implication of AGI in computer science in general. How does it change the way we do science, are programming necessary, are the structure of our society sustainable under the new influence?
