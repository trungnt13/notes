# Semi-supervised learning

+ Inductive: basic of all supervised method, generalize pattern from individual example
  - Wrapper Method: Self-training and Co-training
  - Generative Models: GANs and VAEs
  - Preprocessing: pretraining and feature extraction
+ Transductive: integrate knowledge (e.g. graph) into the model
